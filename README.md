## 1. Pitch

Have you ever been visiting another city, and you're not sure where to dine, or how much to tip after eating? Well we've got you covered. This application is designed for out of town travelers. By entering your destination city, this site provides nine restaurants within any searched area to select from. After enjoying your meal, we will calculate your tip amount (from appropriate to generous) and total your bill. Pretty neat huh?
